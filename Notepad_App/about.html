<h2>Notepad Basics</h2>
<p>This notepad application allows you to create a new note, edit existing notes, and delete
    notes (using a web browser like Firefox or Chrome). There are no accounts, no service logins
    and no software to download. The data you enter lives only on your device.</p>
<p>There are only four pages to the entire site (<a href="./index.html">index.html</a>, <a href="./new_note.html">new_note.html</a>, <a href="./edit_note.html">edit_note.html</a> and <a href="./about.html">about.html</a>)
    one style sheet, <a href="./css/notes.css">notes.css</a>, and one main javascript file to control app functions <a href="./js/storage.js">storage.js</a>. The site makes use of Bootstrap version 5 for layout and convenience.</p>
<p>The site features four buttons (Erase All Notes - remove all notes), (View/Edit - Read or edit a note),
    (Delete/Remove - erase a single note) and (Save - save the note you have created).</p>
<button class="btn btn-danger">All Clear</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-warning">View/Edit</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-danger">Delete/Remove</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-success">Save Note</button><br/><br/>

<p>The quantity of notes you can create, and the length of each note created is limited by the storage
    capacity of your device and by the HTML-5 localStorage implementation of the browser you use.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Privacy of Data</h2>
<p>This notepad application does not save any information onto the cloud (or online), but instead
    uses your local browser (like Firefox or Chrome) via HTML5 localStorage to save notes for
    later retrieval.</p>
<p>The benefit is that your information remains private to your device, and is never harvested, collected,
     shared or sold with any party anywhere in person or virtually.</p>
<p>The shortcoming is that (in its current configuration) your information is only available to you in the browser you created the note in,
    and it does not go from one browser to another, or from one laptop/phone you use to another. In addition,
    if your browser or device fails, there is no possibility of remote data recovery or retrieval.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This notepad application is free to use but absolutely no warranty or guarantee is made about its
    performance, reliability or security.</p>
<p>Savvy users might copy the code and run the app locally, however online users acknowledge that the application
    has no maintenance schedule and may without explanation one day disappear, change, be modified/updated or otherwise suddenly fail.</p>
<p>Any user of this technology agrees to forever hold the author harmless in all circumstances related
    to the use of this app, as well as for anything that could ever happen to them during their current or future lives.</p>
<p>If you are compelled to make a donation, please contact your local food bank or animal rescue who will
    greatly appreciate your charitable contribution.</p>
