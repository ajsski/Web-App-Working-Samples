# In_Browser_Notepad_App
Browser Based Notepad as a Web Application

Application Overview / Summary
This notepad application allows a website visitor to create a new note, edit an existing note, and
delete their notes (using a web browser like Firefox or Chrome). There are no accounts, no
service logins and no software to download. The data entered lives only on the device from
which it is created.

There are only four pages to the entire site (index.html, new_note.html, edit_note.html and
about.html) one style sheet, notes.css, and one main JavaScript file to control app functions
storage.js. The site makes use of Bootstrap version 5 for layout and convenience.
The site features four buttons (Erase All Notes - remove all notes), (View/Edit - Read or edit a
note), (Delete/Remove - erase a single note) and (Save - save the note just created).

The quantity (total number) of notes that can be created, and the length of each note created is
limited by the storage capacity of the browser’s implementation of the HTML-5 localStorage
standard. This means that some users will have larger storage areas than others, and the exact
size of storage is subject to change over time. Typical local storage area is from 2 – 10 MB with
5 MB being average.
